Features:
1. A musical intrument that uses ultrasonic distance sensor
2. Potentiometer (mapped: 1 to 5) controls the frequency and time duration of the tone


The device calculates the distance of an object (in this case, the object behaves as a percussion beater), and based on its location, tunes of varying frequencies are produced. The device allows the user to set the base note using a pushdown switch; once the switch is pressed, the distance calculated at that phase is used as an initial point. Thus, the user can move the beater to and fro in order to create a musical track. Similarly, using the potentiometer, the user can further control the duration and type of sound produced by the buzzer.
